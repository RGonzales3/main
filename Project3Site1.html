 <!-- This is the paragraph for Jimi Hendrix -->
<p class="parapageone">
    <b>James Marshall Hendrix</b> was a guitar enthusiast 
    who developed his interest in music from the age of 15. 
    <br>
    Moving to the UK in the mid-60s, he launched his iconic power trio 
    called <b>The Jimi Hendrix Experience</b> 
    <br>and his unique technique of blues
    guitar and wild soloing quickly made him a superstar. 
    <br>With tracks like Purple Haze, Foxy Lady and Voodoo Chile,
    Hendrix took the electric guitar to whole new, 
    often psychedelic levels.

 <!-- This is my paragraph for Aretha Franklin -->
<p id="arethapara">
    Aretha Franklin's impact on the musical cannon 
    cannot be understated. The Tennesee-born <br> and 
    Detroit-raised star, who started off as a church singer,
    brought her unique <br> brand of soul to the masses. By the late 60s,
    her iconic songs such as <b>Respect, Natural Woman,<br> Think, etc.</b> secured her status 
    as one of the most prominent singers in US history 
    <br>and earned her the title of the Queen of Soul. 
    But she didn't stop there.

    <br>
    <br>

    Aretha used her voice and status for activism and 
    she continued to record <br>and release critically 
    acclaimed albums such as Young Gifted 
    and Black (1972) <br> and Amazing Grace (1972) - 
    while being known globally for her breathtaking 
    performances<br> and collaborations. Aretha's impact on soul 
    and R&B singers cannot be understated <br>
    and everyone from Amy Winehouse to <br>
    Adele (whose <b>Rolling In The Deep</b> song 
    she herself covered) was heavily influenced by the icon.

 <!-- This is my paragraph for Prince -->
<section id="sectprince">
<p>
    Prince Rogers Nelson signed his first record contract aged
    just 19, it was clear from the outset that he was 
    a genius: <br> the Minneapolis musician played every 
    instrument on his debut album For You.
    mixed 70s funk and the post-punk sounds
    of the New Wave, <br> but his love for music was too great to 
    be constrained by genres. <br> If his musical talent wasn't 
    enough to stop you in your tracks, then his persona would. 
    Prince didn't just defy genre, he also defend genders.  <br>  
    Picking up from where Little Richard left off, Prince 
    wasn't afraid to sport anything from fishnet stockings 
    to suspenders and heels.
